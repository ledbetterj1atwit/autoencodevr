# Notes about the autoencoder.

At about 1-5 epochs it just, decides that not rendering green is a pretty good. I disagree.

Its still pretty bad but at 0.04 compression ratio I'm not sure I can complain...

Running on CPU sucks... but now I have CUDA!

Took a while to figure out how to get it to output

18 epochs: is it bottoming out? or just trying to find some new method?
